## Reporting issues

Just create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/twurple/twurple/issues) for both bugs and feature requests.

When creating an issue, you can choose between a bug and a feature request.

**Do not ask for support or ask usage questions in the issue tracker.**
The issue will be closed without any comment since the issue tracker is not a support system.
There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/b9ZqMfz) where you can ask questions.

## Development

### READ THIS FIRST!

If you want to create a new feature, **please file a feature request first**. State that you want to implement the feature by yourself, too.  
We will decide whether we want this feature in the library. You don't want to spend your precious time for nothing, do you?

### General code conventions

- Property names are always nouns.
- Function and method names always start with verbs.
- Acronyms should always be camel cased - if they're at the beginning of a function or method name, they should be all lower case, otherwise they should start with an upper case letter, like normal camel case.
- Types not voluntarily defined for the library (such as Twitch API data structures) should be defined in a `*.external.ts` file, which exempts them from the naming convention.
- All other code conventions are enforced by [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), you'll notice when you're doing it wrong,
  especially when using an IDE or text editor with ESLint support. ;)  
  Use your best judgement when you think you're writing something that needs an exception to the rules, especially the `no-explicit-any` rule. Annotate that exception, so the lint step doesn't fail.

### Getting started

To get started, simply fork the repository, then clone the fork locally:

	git clone https://github.com/your-username/twurple.git
	
If you want to send a bugfix to a non-prerelease version, please check out the respective branch named `versions/x.y` (`x.y` being the current minor version).
On the `main` branch, only ongoing development of future minor and major versions happens.

    git checkout versions/5.2

Bugfixes will be merged back to the `main` branch if applicable.

Then install the dependencies. We use yarn as our package manager, so to make sure you get the exact package versions of the lock file, you should use it too:

	yarn

After fixing the bug you wanted to fix, or implementing a new feature, you should build and lint the whole package in order to prevent unnecessary waiting for the CI to tell you about it:

	yarn run build && yarn run lint

### Documentation & Examples

Documentation contributions are always welcome.

The documentation is automatically built with [documen.ts](https://github.com/d-fischer/documen.ts) from the `docs/` folder.
If you want to create a new documentation page, please reflect the outline structure in the file structure and remember to add it to `docs/config.json` as well.

### Sending a Pull Request

After writing your bug fix, feature or improvement, send a pull request stating what it includes
and [which issue it fixes](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).

We will then review the code changes and either merge it or request further changes.
